# Reframe Your Brain — Book Summary & Practical Reframing Examples

*Reframe Your Brain: The User Interface for Happiness and Success* by **Scott Adams** is a handbook of over **160 mental reframes**—short, powerful perspective shifts that help you think better, feel better, and act smarter.  

Adams argues that reframes don’t have to be *true*—they just have to be *useful*. The idea is simple: change the way you interpret an event, and you change your emotional and behavioral response to it.
